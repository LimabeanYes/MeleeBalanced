# m-ex
**m-ex** is a framework for v1.02 of SSBM that allows for the expansion of content. In addition to this, **m-ex** supports execution of code stored within fighter and stage files. To assist in the writing of custom code, header files with function names/addresses and struct defintions are included in this repo. It is recommended that you add this repo as a submodule to your working repo.

**m-ex** currently expands:
- Fighters
- Items
- Stages
- Main menu
- Character select
- Stage select
- Menus
- Scenes
- Effects
- Particles
- Sounds
- Music
